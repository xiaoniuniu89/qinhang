# Pricing Information

## Lesson Costs

Lessons are priced between **€30-50 per lesson**, depending on several factors:

### Pricing Factors

1. **Student's age** - Different rates for different age groups
2. **Experience level** - Beginner, intermediate, or advanced
3. **Specific learning needs** - Exam preparation, performance goals, etc.
4. **Family discounts** - Multiple students from the same family receive adjusted pricing

### Typical Pricing Structure

Pricing is based on lesson duration (30 or 60 minutes) rather than skill level alone:

- **30-minute lessons**: From €30 (ideal for young children and beginners)
- **60-minute lessons**: €40-50 (for intermediate and advanced students)

**Advanced students** follow the same pricing structure - it depends on whether they choose 30-minute or 60-minute sessions.

## Lesson Duration

Lessons typically last **30-60 minutes** based on the student's needs and stage of learning.

### Standard Lesson Lengths

**30-Minute Lessons** - Recommended for:
- **Young children** - Younger students often find it challenging to maintain focus beyond 30 minutes. This duration is ideal for keeping lessons engaging and productive.
- **Beginners** - When starting out, we focus on fundamentals and foundational knowledge. In the beginning, less is more - 30 minutes allows us to concentrate on basics without overwhelming new students.
- **Maintaining focus** - Half an hour in our experience is the sweet spot for effective learning at these stages.

**Note**: If you prefer an hour-long session for younger children or beginners, we can break it into two 30-minute segments with a short break. However, most parents find that 30 minutes works best.

**45-60 Minute Lessons** - Appropriate for:
- Intermediate and advancing students
- Students preparing for grade examinations
- Those working on more complex repertoire
- Students who can maintain concentration for longer periods

### Extended Sessions (Beyond 1 Hour)

For students requiring extended lesson time, such as:
- Preparing for recitals and performances
- College entrance auditions
